# Business Process Modeling Project (2023-24)

Project provided by the lecturer of the [course](http://didawiki.cli.di.unipi.it/doku.php/magistraleinformaticaeconomia/mpb/start).

The project requires to design a business process for an online movie store first in an at a more abstract level, using e.g., notations such as BPMN or EPC and then transformed into workflow net for the analysis. 
An online movie store allows customers to log in, browse the catalogue, search by title or author, and stream trailers. Customers can add or remove movies from a playlist. To checkout, they select an expiration date, enter credit card details for payment, and receive an email confirmation once the movies are available for download. After checkout, customers can either log out or create a new playlist.

BPMN is selected to represent the process model due to its standardized notation, suitability for process orchestration, and ability to clearly define roles and manage handoffs between them.
